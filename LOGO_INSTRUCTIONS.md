# Add Your Logo

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your logo image** (the bear with bottle) as: `logo.png`

2. **Move it to the public folder:**
   ```
   c:/Users/Harsh/OneDrive/Desktop/freshozz/public/logo.png
   ```

3. **That's it!** The website will automatically use it.

## Supported Formats:
- PNG (recommended - transparent background)
- SVG (best for scalability)
- JPG/JPEG

## Recommended Size:
- Width: 200-400px
- Height: 100-200px
- The navbar will auto-resize it to fit
